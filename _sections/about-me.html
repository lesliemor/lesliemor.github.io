<p>I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Southern California, majoring in Computer Science with a Mathematics minor.
    My career interests lie in artificial intelligence research, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
    
    Growing up in Hudson County, New Jersey as the child of Colombian immigrants, I was surrounded by a diverse community like no other. Memories of debating
    with my friends over whether the word for straw was "pitillo", "popote", or "sorbete" planted the seed for a fasincation with language. Now as a computer science major,
    my projects surround all aspects of language, whether it be in my work analyzing speech patterns in people with Dementia, or aiding in endangered language preservation. 
    I plan to pursue a Doctorate's Degree to continue my work with AI and language.
